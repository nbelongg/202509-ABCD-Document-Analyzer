Difficulties in learning to write: - the process of learning written speech is constantly complicated by discrepancies between the sound and graphic way of expressing thought - a written statement must be specific and complete in order to fulfill its communicative function - there is no way to expressively into tone your speech - a written work requires special grammatical and syntactic design In addition, students face the following difficulties: - limited vocabulary - Fear of spelling and grammatical errors - interference of the native language at the level of a word, phrase, sentence and text - limited skills of self-organization, planning - lack of ideas or ways to express them, lack of motivation Written speech allows you to save linguistic knowledge, serves as a reliable tool for thinking, stimulates speaking, listening and reading in a foreign language. Writing and written speech in the methodology of teaching English act as a means of teaching, as well as the goal of teaching the language. Writing is the technical component of written language. Written speech is a productive type of speech activity, which is expressed in the coding of a certain content with graphic signs. Having studied the data of psychologists on the assimilation of material in various ways, which are given below, one can once again be convinced of the important role of teaching writing and writing skills. It is important to note that for a more productive learning of writing and writing, as well as for learning any other aspect of the language, motivation is required, which must be constantly developed. Students are very often reluctant to write, this is due to the difficulties they face, as well as the lack of motivation. It is necessary to interest students, to emphasize the importance of mastering written speech. This is hard and painstaking work, which, with the right organization, gives consistently positive results. <b> </b><b>REFERENCES:</b> 1. Abrar M.

According to Bueno, Madrid and McLaren: &#34;Listening is important for speaking because it establishes the good basis for successful communicative exchanges‖ (2006:344). There are several activities that integrate listening-comprehension with speaking: - Integrated skills work (jigsaw-listening, for example) - Using video, Using the language laboratory, Using computers and CD-ROMs - During games, Using pop songs (probably the most popular listening activity with secondary students), Listening as homework These activities integrate speaking because the songs, videos or listening text-topic is the springboard for a discussion, drill or pronunciation practice. Integrated activities also provide opportunities for much needed learner behavioral-interaction described by Lynch (1997) earlier. Dictations integrate listening and speaking. Although they have not been very fashionable dictations are at the moment once again seen as relevant. Dictations may also be used as a means to evaluate learners‘ listening comprehension, as long as the scoring is carefully done. In the same way that a good writer is a good reader, a good speaker is also a good listener. This rule is generally applicable to L2 learners and it has to do with the correlation between productive (writing and speaking) and receptive (reading and listening) skills (Bueno, Madrid and McLaren, 2005:344). Second language learners, as implied in a special type of exchange, have to be provided with the <!-- p {margin: 0; padding: 0;} .ft20{font-size:16px;font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;} .ft21{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft22{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman,Bold;color:#000000;} .ft23{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman,BoldItalic;color:#000000;} .ft24{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman,Italic;color:#000000;} .ft25{font-size:16px;line-height:18px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft26{font-size:16px;line-height:19px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft27{font-size:16px;line-height:15px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft28{font-size:16px;line-height:22px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;}-->206 appropriate input and output so that they have the opportunities to practice both skills at the same time. In this sense, a wide range of communicative exercises should be proposed in the classroom and these should be as varied as possible: between students, a student and the teacher, the students and the CD/computer, etc. in this sense, Brown et al. claim: There are listening activities called &#34;live listening‖. In these kind of activities, the teachers or visitors talk face to face with the students, which is a way of interaction to practice listening and learning about different accents, intonation, paralinguistic features. For example, if the teacher is reading aloud, this activity allows students to hear how English sounds clearly. Telling a story is a suitable material that provides listening material, students can predict what will happen or they can describe the characters in a story, it is a good way of improving vocabulary. In pairs, they can also do an interview or a conversation. It is a good method because aside from listening, they are integrating speaking and it is a motivating activity when they think of their own questions or the subject is funny and interesting. There are also activities with films, for example, where students can analyze some trailers or describe characters of their favorite scenes. All of them are ideas of live listening, which are very useful for students and teachers in Secondary Education. According to the results obtained, we can notice that listening and speaking competences are complex skills that need to be developed consciously. Day by day school life is when students really learn the mentioned skills previously. Sometimes, it is only when a child spontaneously uses vocabulary or expresses his own opinion related to a previous listening or reading aloud carried out in the classroom. An idea would be giving pupils opportunities to use their speaking and listening skills in real life situations, giving them the sense of what they are learning in situations that they do not have in the classroom. EFL classes must experience rich and well-integrated opportunities to participate in listening, speaking, reading, and writing through well-planned activities by the English language teachers. <b> </b><b>REFERENCES: </b>1.

Due to the ever-increasing importance of reading in every aspect of our everyday life, it is essential to find ways or methods to improve our reading skills. To this purpose, a great emphasis is laid on the use of reading strategies as the best way so far to improve students‘ reading skills. Researchers have found that teaching reading strategies is a key element in developing student comprehension. However, many teachers lack a solid foundation for teaching these reading comprehension strategies. Therefore, teachers need to be prepared on how to design effective comprehension strategies and how to teach these strategies to their students. Therefore, this study aims to study the effective reading strategies in order to improve reading skills in language classes. The study is an action research applied to a number of 14 students in an intermediate level integrated skills course. The main question of the study is ―Would reading strategies help my students‘ reading comprehension studies?‖ The results of the study indicate that the students had an improvement to a great extend have been tutored about the reading strategies. Reading is a lifelong skill to be used both at school and throughout life. According to Anderson, Hiebert, Scott, &amp; Wilkinson, reading is a basic life skill. It is a cornerstone for a child's success in school and, indeed, throughout life. Without the ability to read well, opportunities for personal fulfilment and job success inevitably will be lost (1985). Despite its importance, reading is one of the most challenging areas in the education system. The ever-increasing demand for high levels of literacy in our technological society makes this problem even more pressing (Snow, Burns, &amp;Griffin, 1998).",2022,"Djoldasbaeva, Kh",https://inlibrary.uz/index.php/rpietc/article/view/5594,Djoldasbaeva - 2022 - Integrated methods of teaching listening and speak,

One of these features is the ability to divide students in groups with the assistance of breakout rooms. The idea is to continue using all traditional classroom activities online. It might be discussion, collaborative writing task, warm-up, project and any other type of activity which requires teamwork. For instance, a teacher might assign a task ―From A to Z‖ which requires students to find one word for each letter of the alphabet to a particular theme as an ice-breaker almost to any topic such as Travelling, Education, Business, etc. The procedure of the task and instructions are explained during the main session and then a teacher divides learners into teams. It can be done randomly by the program or an educator can assign each student to a particular team. One of the benefits of such function is that it helps to manage time in the most effective way as the host of the conference can end breakout rooms for all teams and require them to return to the main session to share to results of the given assignment. It is also possible to monitor the working process of each team by entering each group one by one and checking their progress, although an obstacle might be that a teacher cannot control other teams simultaneously which can lead to switching to L1 by the students. Nevertheless, it is an effective way to make students communicate and interact with each other. The implication of this study is that online tools such as Kahoot, Quizizz, Padlet and Zoom can create an effective environment for interactive online lessons an encourage students to participate in the class as enthusiastically as it would be in the traditional face-to-face lesson using modern methods and approaches to teaching ESL. <b> </b><b>REFERENCES: </b>1.

Increasingly, in interpreting the models of a modern specialist, the emphasis is not only on mastering a foreign language by a graduate, but also on developing the ability of such a specialist to comprehend and accept cultural values that differ from his own. Therefore, along with linguistic knowledge, the formation of speech skills and abilities, it is necessary to determine a set of cultural <!-- p {margin: 0; padding: 0;} .ft20{font-size:16px;font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;} .ft21{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft22{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman,Italic;color:#000000;} .ft23{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman,Bold;color:#000000;} .ft24{font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;} .ft25{font-size:16px;line-height:18px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft26{font-size:16px;line-height:19px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft27{font-size:16px;line-height:22px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft28{font-size:16px;line-height:15px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;}-->182 knowledge that will allow a future specialist in any field to use a foreign language in order to carry out intercultural and professional communication with native speakers of the studied foreign language. The effectiveness of the linguocultural approach for the most complete study of a foreign language and the formation of intercultural professional and communicative competence among students of non-linguistic specialties is beyond doubt in the didactic scientific environment.

Byram, teaching culture in the process of teaching the language expands the horizons of students, which in general is of great educational and educational importance [Byram 1989, p. 4]. <i>Implementation of a linguoculturological approach in teaching a foreign language to students of </i><i>non-linguistic specialties. </i>Based on the experience of working with students of non-linguistic specialties, we can say that the teaching of a foreign language as an aspect of a foreign language culture at non-linguistic faculties in universities of the Republic of Karakalpakstan is not sufficiently developed. Despite the understanding of the need to include a foreign language culture in the process of teaching a foreign language, in most cases students are introduced to individual fragments of the regional and cultural plan. On the other hand, there is an acute problem of purposeful selection of the most suitable educational material and work with texts of a professional orientation. Constant changes, the importance of tracking the timely reflection in educational materials of innovations in the chosen professional field require not only a formed secondary language, but also cognitive consciousness, both from the teacher and the student. And although the development of the Uzbek methodology of foreign language education is beyond doubt, at present it is necessary to develop, theoretically substantiate and practically test a methodology that would contribute to introducing the student to a foreign language picture of the world. In the process of foreign language learning, students must acquire a given amount of background knowledge, defined in modern methodology as a ―frame presupposition‖ [Furmanova 1993]. I. I. Khaleeva considers frame presuppositions as a necessary condition that forms the cognitive consciousness of a secondary linguistic personality. The author also believes that in the absence of a formed national-culturally colored network of frames, the understanding of foreign language texts becomes impossible [Khaleeva 1989]. O. L. Digina notes that in order to study the systems of linguocultural units, one should resort to the method of the linguocultural field, which is methodically implemented through the consideration of cross-cutting cultural topics. ―When using the linguocultural field, the emphasis is on the reflection in the language of a certain representative block of national culture, establishing hierarchical subject relationships between concepts within this block and between blocks‖ [Digina 2009, p. 100–101]. As the author further notes, the learning process should be based on specially selected texts containing frame presuppositions [Digina 2009]. As you can see, frame presuppositions are defined by Russian scientists as important, accumulated background knowledge that allows students to form the most complete foreign picture of the world. At the same time, the so-called ―knowledge background‖ in the perception of texts by a student (potential secondary language personality) should be provided with a purposeful system of learning tasks. Thus, the implementation of the linguocultural approach in teaching a foreign language to students of non-linguistic specialties of universities of the Republic of Karakalpakstan should be carried out through the subject content of the discipline &#34;Foreign Language&#34;, which at each level of education is presented in the form of CLC (or, cognitive-linguocultural complexes). The component composition of such CLC is represented by the communicative sphere, reflecting the content of this level of education; a set of speech topics and subtopics of communication that implement each of the presented areas; typical situations of communication. <b>REFERENCES:</b> 1.

A feeling of accomplishment, satisfaction, and pride can be the result of contributing to the ―greater cause‖ of our ―way of knowing.‖ Research is a complex, exacting, and complex process that yields the ultimate reward of truth or at least a path leading to it [Bailey, D. M.: 1997]. Using innovative ways of doing research is one to achieve a great goal. <b>REFERENCES: </b>1. Çaparlar CÖ, Dönmez A.

These research studies have generally concentrated on students‘ perceptions and evaluations of the suitability of technological devices for language learning, adoption of these technological devices in the classroom settings, and the factors that affect the effectiveness of language learning in classroom technology-using conditions. For example, P. Winke and S. Goertler found that songs and movies were the most frequently used technologies and the ease of access was the strongest predictor of the frequency of technology use [Winke; Goertler: 2008] Recent research on technology-facilitated language learning, however, has been mostly laboratory and classroom experiments of technology applications in the formal educational contexts Consequently, our knowledge and understanding of students‘ self-regulated use of technology for target language learning is still limited. Aspects of technology-assisted language learning such as goal setting, motivation-regulation, and cognitive strategy use particularly in an English as a Foreign Language – EFL context remains in need of further empirical inquiry. After all, in the course of learning a second or foreign language, learners are at the center of learning and play an instrumental role in shaping outcomes of their learning experiences. Key to this view of learner-centredness is self-regulation and learners taking the responsibility for their own learning [Holec: 1981]. Nevertheless, what is lacking in recent research on technology-assisted language learning is a systematic examination of SRL strategies in technology-using conditions particularly in an EFL context. This study investigated university students‘ technology-assisted self-regulated learning – SRL strategies and whether the technology-based SRL strategies mediated the associations between English language self-efficacy, English enjoyment, and learning outcomes. <!-- p {margin: 0; padding: 0;} .ft20{font-size:16px;font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;} .ft21{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman,Bold;color:#000000;} .ft22{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft23{font-size:12px;font-family:Symbol;color:#000000;} .ft24{font-size:12px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;} .ft25{font-size:16px;line-height:18px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft26{font-size:16px;line-height:19px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft27{font-size:16px;line-height:15px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft28{font-size:16px;line-height:22px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;}-->191 <b>Self-Regulated Learning: </b>Self-regulated learning has been widely acknowledged to be learners‘ systematic effort to manage and regulate their learning process in order to achieve particular learning goals. While different theoretical models provide different definitions of SRL, there is a consensus that SRL is a multifaceted construct containing cognitive, meta-cognitive, behavioral, and self-motivational aspects. According to P.R. Pintrich et al., cognitive strategies refer to the skills that learners use to process the information and knowledge when completing a task. They help students to construct, transform, and apply second language – L2 knowledge [Pintrich: 1991]; [Oxford: 2013]. Social-behavioral strategies, as a key aspect of self-regulation, involve learners‘ control over their learning behavior under the influence of contextual aspects. Finally, motivational strategies refer to the procedure or thoughts students applied intentionally to sustain or increase their interest to engage in a task. In various models of SRL in the literature, self-regulated learners are depicted as being capable of controlling over the cognitive, emotional, motivational, and behavioral aspects of learning [Zimmerman; Schunk: 2011]. Research also shows that those more effective at self-regulation use a broader repertoire of learning strategies and persist longer in the face of adversity compared to their less self-regulated counterparts.<b> </b><b>Self-Regulated Language Learning in Technology-Using Conditions: </b>P. Benson<b> </b>described two important categories of learning resources: traditional learning resources, for example, reference and course books and resources provided by modern educational technology, for example, information communication technology applications. According to P. Benson, self-regulation is manifested not only in the active regulation of learning strategies but also in the management of different kinds of learning resources [Benson: 2001].<b> </b>As such, technology-based self-regulated English learning – SRL strategies refer to specific actions taken by the learners to learn English or to enhance their English learning in technology-using conditions. A large quantity of technology-assisted SRL strategies were identified in previous studies conducted in a variety of research contexts, such as consulting online dictionaries, using translation software, reading texts on the computer, searching the web for information, listening to the radio, exploring cultural knowledge on YouTube and so on. The investigated role of mobile phone technology in the employment of language learning strategies among the undergraduate students shows that the study employed a self-designed questionnaire to collect data on students‘ language learning strategies, which was based on the classification of the language learning strategies. The results show that different types of mobile phone-assisted language learning strategies are helpful in improving students‘ English proficiency. Nevertheless, constrained by the adoption of classification of the language learning strategies, these studies largely focused on students‘ use of cognitive and meta-cognitive strategies. Furthermore, self-regulation is context-specific and situation-specific, which means that measurement of technology-based self-regulated language learning should be domain-specific [Wang; Zhan: 2020] <b>Self-Efficacy: </b>Self-efficacy refers to individuals‘ personal evaluations of their capability of accomplishing a particular task. According to P. Benson efficacy beliefs influence the courses of action people choose to pursue, the challenges and goals they set for themselves and their commitment to them, how much effort they put forth in given endeavors, and the outcomes they expect their efforts to produce [Benson: 2001]. While there is prolific research on self-efficacy in the general education field, it is only within the past two decades that self-efficacy has been attracting researchers‘ attention in the field of L2 acquisition. A study of the influence of self-efficacy and other motivational self-beliefs on the achievement among college intermediate students also revealed that self-efficacy for self-regulation was the most significant predictor of intermediate foreign language achievement, and that students who perceived themselves as capable of using effective meta-cognitive strategies to monitor their academic work time effectively were more apt to experience academic success in intermediate foreign language. Recently, a number of L2 studies tended to develop new self-report self-efficacy measurements to investigate the role of self-efficacy in the L2 learning process. For example, to address the need for valid and reliable tools to assess ESL learners‘ self-efficacy, developed the English Self-Efficacy Questionnaire to measure English self-efficacy in the following four areas: · English listening; · English speaking; · English reading; · English writing. Subsequent Confirmatory factory analysis – CFA with data from university students confirmed a second-order common factor with these four first-order latent constructs: <!-- p {margin: 0; padding: 0;} .ft30{font-size:16px;font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;} .ft31{font-size:12px;font-family:Symbol;color:#000000;} .ft32{font-size:12px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;} .ft33{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft34{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman,Bold;color:#000000;} .ft35{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman,Italic;color:#000000;} .ft36{font-size:16px;line-height:18px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft37{font-size:16px;line-height:19px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft38{font-size:16px;line-height:15px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft39{font-size:16px;line-height:22px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft310{font-size:16px;line-height:18px;font-family:Times New Roman,Bold;color:#000000;}-->192 · English listening · English speaking · English reading, and · English writing. To date, studies that adopted the English Self-Efficacy Questionnaire showed that students‘ English language self-efficacy influenced their use SRL [Wang; Zhan: 2020]. English language self-efficacy was also found to positively influence students‘ feedback preferences and behavior in academic English course settings. Among the positive emotions, enjoyment has been recognized as a most typical positive emotion experienced by foreign language learners and has received increasing attention from researchers in the field of educational psychology. Enjoyment was a sense of satisfaction and reward that generated from activities or the achievement of activities. In the literature of educational psychology, enjoyment is often defined as a positive psychological state coming from the efforts by the person who stretches beyond himself to accomplish something challenging or difficult [Lake: 2015]. Clearly, it can be concluded from the above review that while there has been an attempt to integrate learning strategies with elements of SRL and meta-cognition in the context of technology supported language learning, the literature on the application of self-regulation in technology-supported second language learning is still fairly limited. Although the importance of the role of the strategic and motivational factors in first and second language contexts has been well documented, how these factors function in relation to students‘ learning achievement in the context of technology use for self-regulated language learning has been under-researched. <b>Conclusion:</b><i> </i>This study contributes to the knowledge about EFL undergraduate students‘ SRL strategies in technology-using conditions. The results of the study add to the literature that considers how technology-based SRL strategies are associated with students‘ language learning achievement. From a theoretical perspective, the research extends SRL theories to technology-using language learning conditions, particularly with respect to the significant role of English enjoyment and English language self-efficacy, and in relation to students‘ English learning outcomes. Pedagogically, awareness of the complex interrelationships among SRL strategies, English enjoyment, English language self-efficacy, and learning outcomes is helpful for educators to clearly understand what actually motivates and empowers students‘ self-directed technology use for learning and the quality of this technology-based learning process. It is thus important for educators to create a pleasant and inspiring environment that empowers students in self-regulation of their technology-facilitated English learning practices so that they experience learning success and satisfaction inside and outside the classroom. Self-learning is not just about performing better in the classroom or outside the classroom. It is about being able to aim the life in whatever direction to choose and conquering the obstacles. Learning an unused ability can be very a part of fun. There's so much data accessible in the day and time which, in case utilized accurately, can genuinely offer assistance to learn a part of modern abilities and encourage in advance. <b> </b><b>REFERENCES: </b>1.<b> </b>Benson P.

This article illustrates the significance of vocabulary range and some techniques which are used effectively by English teachers. <b>Key words:</b> vocabulary, techniques and methods <b>Аннотация: </b>Словарный запас всегда рассматривался как центральная часть изучения языка, поскольку люди сталкиваются с рядом препятствий, когда они изучают новые языки. Точно так же большинство учителей сомневаются в том, как правильно преподавать лексику и с чего начать. Эта статья иллюстрирует значение словарного запаса и некоторые методы, которые эффективно используются учителями английского языка. <b>Ключевые слова:</b> лексика, упражнения и методы Vocabulary is considered as one of the essential aspects of acquiring language and its development. Limited vocabulary range prohibits succeeding in learning language, in particular, for second language learners since it never ends. Although a person can make grammatically accurate sentences, insufficient vocabulary range limits the learner‘s communication with others. If a person knows only the words but not the grammar, he can express or communicate what he is going to say by pronouncing the words. As we know, without knowing how to request information in a foreign language, we can make sentences in the native language using suitable words and specify what we need. According to Napa, states that ‗it is a fact that vocabulary is one of the components of the language. There are no languages that exist without words. They are the means by which people exchange their thoughts. The more words we learn the more ideas we should have. This way we can communicate our ideas more effectively. It is not easy to teach vocabulary, especially new vocabulary, to junior high school students, because teaching it requires an explanation of every part. However, at other times the teacher should see that the meaning and use of words should also be given a lot of attention‘ [Napa: 1991]. <!-- p {margin: 0; padding: 0;} .ft20{font-size:16px;font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;} .ft21{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft22{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman,Bold;color:#000000;} .ft23{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#222222;} .ft24{font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#222222;} .ft25{font-size:16px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;} .ft26{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#0000ff;} .ft27{font-size:16px;line-height:18px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft28{font-size:16px;line-height:22px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft29{font-size:16px;line-height:19px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;}-->173 It is necessary to make a few remarks about the most commonly used English terms denoting the concept of &#34;vocabulary&#34; (from the Latin 'name', also called word stock, lexicon, and lexis) can be defined as all the words in a language that are understood by a particular person or group of people. A.S. Hornby, English linguist and methodologist, widely known for his works in the field of methods of teaching English to foreigners in ―The Advanced Learner‘s Dictionary of Current English‖ states that vocabulary is: (1) all words that a person knows or uses, (2) all words in a particular language, (3) words that people use when they talk, and (4) a list of words with their meanings, especially in a book for learning a foreign language [A.S. Hornby:2006]. As a matter of fact, the practical significance of the Hornby Dictionary for foreign learners English is difficult to overestimate. This relatively small dictionary reference is intended for people who have mastered the basics of the English language within high school. With its help, they can read and comprehend modern fiction, popular science and socio-political literature. Despite its small volume, it registers exactly those words of the modern English language that are most often found in colloquial and in modern literary texts [L.P.Stupin: 1985] Considering all above mentioned, Nation confirms that vocabulary is central to language. This means that vocabulary is the main element of the language. A language is an expression that is constructed using words or vocabulary. Words are tools that are used for thinking, expressing ideas and feelings, as well as for cognition of the world. When learning a language, vocabulary is an important component. It is associated with the four skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing [Nation: 2001] In other words, we can say that vocabulary is the most important tool that people use to communicate with each other. Thus, knowledge of vocabulary is often seen as a key way to learn a second language due to the fact that a limited vocabulary hinders successful communication in this language. As Nation further describes, the relationship between knowledge of vocabulary and the use of language is complementary: knowledge of vocabulary allows the use of language, and, conversely, the use of language leads to an increase in knowledge of vocabulary. Recent achievements in the field of learning second and foreign languages emphasize that non-native speakers, in addition to grammar and pronunciation, need a solid foundation of vocabulary knowledge to become successful users of English in any academic environment. Thus, regardless of the degree of competence of students in grammar and pronunciation, without sufficient knowledge of vocabulary, they cannot communicate effectively. This is largely due to the fact that vocabulary carries more meaning of the text than grammar. In fact, grammatical errors lead to illiterate utterances, while incorrect use of vocabulary affects the communicative act. That is, vocabulary is one of the linguistic components that influence the development of communicative competence, as well as the language skills of students [Nation:2001]. All things are considered, the knowledge of vocabulary is considered as the most important tool for mastering any language skills; it also contributes to the understanding of written and oral texts. Thus, despite more frequent familiarity with vocabulary, students are more confident in understanding and interpreting the meaning of some unknown words from the context. Indeed, learning vocabulary means not only learning new words, but also knowing their functions and applicability to different contexts and situations. In other words, the comprehension and production of language depends on the simultaneous and complex process of extracting and constructing utterances through the use of appropriate lexical combinations at the appropriate time and place. Students should learn the language not only as an abstract system of vocal signs, as if it were a kind of grammatical text with an accompanying dictionary, but also as a tool that allows students to know which utterances are useful for effective communication, and to know which utterances are appropriate or not appropriate to use in a given context. <b> </b><b>REFERENCES: </b>1.

The importance and role of motivation in learning foreign languages has been proven by different research. For the first time the word motivation was used by A. Schopenhauer in the article ―Four Principles of Sufficient Cause‖ (1900–1910). Then this term entered into psychological use for explain the causes of human and animal behavior. Currently, motivation as a mental phenomenon is interpreted in different ways. In one case - as a set of factors that support and guide, i.e., determine behavior (K. Madsen, 1959; J. Godfroy, 1992), in another case - as a set of motives (K.K. Platonov, 1986), in the third case - as an impulse that causes the activity of the organism and determines its direction. The word motivation is derived from the word motive. ―A motive is an impulse to activity associated with the satisfaction of a person's need; a set of external and internal conditions that cause the activity of the subject and determine its direction. The term motivation refers to a system of rewards or incentives that can have a positive impact on the degree of assimilation of the material and the effectiveness of developing skills and abilities. Therefore, in the methodology of teaching foreign languages, the formation of a motive for learning is always an important priority not only for the educational process as a whole, but also for each teacher. The task of foreign language teacher is, along with all educational and developmental aspects, to form the student's desire to learn a foreign language, to generate such an important phenomenon, as a motivation. A teacher of a foreign language is always faced with the question of how to encourage students to learn a language, how to interest and maintain this interest for a long time, how to develop an interest in learning foreign languages. It should be remembered that learning motivation is closely related to social factors, since many factors that influence on learning motivation, is formed under the influence of society and social conditions. As L.A.Regush said: ―Because learning motivation is mostly is socially conditioned, the possibilities for managing it in the pedagogical process are very wide‖<b> [</b>Regush.L.A 2011<b>:</b> p. 243]. Learning motivation is a process that involves the use of various motives and incentives for the student. The student's attitude to learning is largely determined by the system of motives of the person himself. At the same time, we must not forget that there are other factors that influence the learning process and the formation of educational motivation. Some experts classify motives by type, ―in this regard, internal and external motives are distinguished‖ [Reanh A.A 2011, p. 97] Internal motives arise within the person himself. With an internal motive, the learning process itself is a source of satisfaction, when, for example, in the foreground the student is interested in implementing the process and achieving the best result. External motives are due to external components, in other words, they are formed under the influence of the teacher, other persons and society, other external circumstances. Undoubtedly, the effectiveness of the process of teaching a foreign language depends on many factors, but motivation in a foreign language class plays a very important role. R.M. Ryan and E.L. Deci note that internal motivation dominates in importance, reflecting the internal desire of the individual to learn and acquire knowledge, while external motivation can vary considerably in its relative autonomy and, accordingly, can be a reflection of either external control or self-regulation. So, external motivation can be divided into several types. In the first case, students with a pronounced external motivation carry out activities with indignation, indignation, and reluctance. in the second case, we are talking about the forced desire of the individual to perform certain actions, but at the <!-- p {margin: 0; padding: 0;} .ft20{font-size:16px;font-family:Calibri;color:#000000;} .ft21{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft22{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman,Bold;color:#000000;} .ft23{font-size:21px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft24{font-size:21px;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;} .ft25{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#0000ff;} .ft26{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman,BoldItalic;color:#000000;} .ft27{font-size:16px;font-family:Times New Roman,Italic;color:#000000;} .ft28{font-size:10px;font-family:Times New Roman,Italic;color:#000000;} .ft29{font-size:16px;line-height:18px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft210{font-size:16px;line-height:19px;font-family:Times New Roman;color:#000000;} .ft211{font-size:16px;line-height:18px;font-family:Times New Roman,Bold;color:#000000;}-->210 same time it is a reflection of the manifestation of the will or internal acceptance of the value of the task <b>[</b>Ryan R.M., Deci E.L.<b>]</b> Motives and motivation are the driving force behind the learning process. It is motivation that is the main means that will make it possible to increase the level of students' interest in the educational process. Therefore, the education system as a whole and teachers, as the most important subjects of this system, should always pay great attention to the principle of motivation, create situations in which students have an interest in the educational material. To achieve this goal, teachers must enhance both extrinsic and intrinsic motivation to learn. However, internal motives prevail over external ones, because in external motivation a student can perform educational activities under the influence of external factors. Circumstances, and intrinsic motivation is abstract and related to pleasure, satisfaction, a sense of accomplishment within the person himself and can even affect extrinsic motivation. <b> </b><b>REFERENCES</b>: 1.

Going to school and getting an education was something that only the richest people could afford. The role of a teacher or educator was considered the most important in the learning process, as they gave children invaluable knowledge and wisdom.<b> </b>However, educators were not the first educators. Wealthy residents of the area used slaves to take their children to school. They were considered experienced and wise, who passed on knowledge to the children who were led to school. This is how the word &#34;teacher&#34; came about. He is described as the &#34;leader of the children&#34;. They guide students both academically and morally. Teaching methods are broader methods used to help learners achieve learning outcomes, and activities are the various ways in which these methods are implemented. Teaching methods help students to master the course content and learn how to apply content in specific contexts. <b>Key words</b>: teacher, teaching, pedagogy, methods, learning process, leader of the children, learning outcomes, activities, course, academically and morally, content, specific context, guide, pass on knowledge. <b>INTRODUCTION </b>Pedagogy refers to the way in which students are taught, be it theory or practice of learning. It is the link between culture and teaching methods. The main goal of pedagogy in the XXI century is to build on students' previous knowledge and work to develop students' skills and attitudes. Pedagogy allows students to gain a complete understanding of the subject and helps them apply the acquired knowledge in everyday life outside the classroom. <b> </b>Pedagogy defines the methods adopted for the conduct of teaching sessions, using the various strategies and approaches adopted by teachers to ensure that the goal is achieved. Pedagogy is strongly influenced by educational psychology and child psychology. This concerns not only the improvement of teaching methods, but also the analysis of student responses. Overall, its main goal is to develop an effective learning experience.<b> </b>Pedagogy, the study of teaching methods includes, the goals of education and the achievement of these goals. This field relies heavily on educational psychology, which advocates a scientific theory of education, and to some extent limits philosophical education, which presupposes goals and appeals to education from a philosophical point of view.<b> </b>",2022,"Pirnazarova, Sh; Atashova, F",https://inlibrary.uz/index.php/rpietc/article/view/5596,Pirnazarova and Atashova - 2022 - The role of motivation in teaching foreign languag,
