     - The paper does not explicitly address multiple forms of marginalization but focuses more on improving decision-making through understanding and experience.
   - **Behavioral Principles Applied**:
     - **Environmental Predictability**: Utilizes principles related to understanding and predicting environmental factors to enhance decision-making.
     - **Learning and Experience**: Relies on the growth and learning of individuals to improve their intuitive judgments.

4. **Key Findings and Learnings**
   - **Effectiveness of Solutions**:
     - The paper concludes that reliable evaluation of intuitive judgment requires understanding both the predictability of the environment and the individual's learning opportunities.
     - Subjective confidence is not a reliable measure of judgment accuracy; therefore, other factors need to be used to evaluate intuitive decisions.
   - **Outcomes for Different Identities**:
     - The study provides insights into understanding how different environments and experiences impact the development of intuitive judgment, though it does not specifically focus on different intersectional identities.
   - **Lessons for Future Programs**:
     - For organizations aiming to improve decision-making, it's crucial to:
       - **Assess Environmental Factors**: Recognize the importance of environmental predictability to ensure accurate intuitive judgment.
       - **Foster Learning Opportunities**: Provide ample and structured opportunities for individuals to learn from their experiences and the environment.
       - **Recognize Limits of Subjectivity**: Move beyond subjective confidence to more robust measures of judgment accuracy.
  
**Concluding Remarks:**
Although the paper doesn't explicitly address intersectional dimensions or SDGs, its insights into professional intuition are valuable. By understanding the nuances between HB and NDM approaches, organizations can implement strategies to improve decision-making, particularly by focusing on the learning environments and objective assessments of their professional intuition.","# Summary of Research Paper: Exploring Differences Between Heuristics and Biases (HB) and Naturalistic Decision Making (NDM)
